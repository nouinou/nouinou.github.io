I've discovered that the more I learn and advance in my career as a software engineer, the more I need/want to learn. I discover more gaps in the content I read or watch. I generally want to fill those gaps as I go on my journey.

Because there are so many topics that could be covered, it can be challenging to focus on a small number of essential concepts that you must thoroughly comprehend before deciding when to move on to other topics.

Hello worlds and todos tutorials and blog posts will only get you so far and they could cause you to end up trapped in [tutorial hell](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/blog/what-is-tutorial-hell-how-to-get-out/#:~:text=Tutorial%20hell%20is%20a%20metaphysical,it%20has%20no%20natural%20end){:target="_blank"} especially if they make assumptions about your prior knowledge without explicitly addressing them. I want to share all the knowledge I wish someone had given to me when I was starting out.

My goal in publishing this blog is to document my development journey goes and make the knowledge I've had to acquire in order to develop and obtain better employment in this field understandable to anyone, and by anyone, I mean everyone. No matter where they start, everybody can learn.

Writing article about coding does not only benefit the reader but also the writer. Keeping a journal of my experience will be very beneficial to me in many ways. One them is to [become a better developer](https://venturebeat.com/business/how-teaching-can-make-you-a-better-programmer/){:target="_blank"} because explaining something drives the person to learn more about the subject, which is good for both him and the receiver. 

Another perk is to keep a record of the difficulties I have encountered and how I have overcome them because, frequently, I am forced to look for solutions to issues I have already resolved in order to refresh my memory of the them. Speaking of memory, it will also help me overcome [impostor syndrome](https://www.verywellmind.com/imposter-syndrome-and-social-anxiety-disorder-4156469){:target="_blank"} by serving as a reminder of the challenges I faced and overcame.

If something I posted in any article doesn't make sense to you, please get in touch with me and we'll figure it out.
